# Life Log

This Pebble Watchapp keeps track of any event in your life that you care
to manually mark, and displays them in the form of a log.

The point of this app is mostly an easier access than the phone or a piece
of paper, and automatically tracking the current time.

I use it to track my caffeine consumption and a few other things that might
be relevant, in order to correlate them with sleep data.
